# Sales Analysis and Dashboard Creation

## Objective

- Analyze Q4 sales performance by product categories, individual products, monthly trends, customers, and employees.
- Identify key insights and suggest actionable recommendations.
- Create an interactive dashboard to effectively showcase the findings.

## Dataset

I will use a dataset obtained from the open-source Northwind.db database. The dataset is stored in a file named “data_sale_q4.csv“.

## Project Workflow

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Questions to Answer:

- Which product categories generated the highest sales in Q4?
- Which products achieved the highest sales in Q4?
- Which month had the highest sales during Q4?
- Which customers spent the most in Q4?
